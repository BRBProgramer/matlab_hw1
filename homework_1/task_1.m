% Assignment: Homework 1
 
% a) Create a variable `radius` and assign it a value of 5.
% b) Calculate the area of a circle with this radius and store it in a variable called `area`.
% c) Calculate the circumference of the circle and store it in a variable called `circumference`.
% d) Display the results with appropriate labels.

%Completed File: 

r = 5;
%res = pi *r^2
%fprintf("The area of the circle is %area",res);

res = 2 *pi *r
fprintf("The Circumference of the circle is %Circumference", res)
